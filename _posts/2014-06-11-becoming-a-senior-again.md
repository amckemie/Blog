<strong><span style="color:red;font-size:30px">Senioritis.</span></strong> If only there was enough time at MakerSquare to feel senioritis. Sigh. In my third time of becoming a senior in my life (first highschool, then college, just in case you needed some help there), it feels 100% different. I'm not eagerly counting down the days, hours, minutes, and seconds until I no longer have to be in school and doing this work. Rather, I'm diligently working on a way to slow down time.

Ha, if only. While I am eager to get out into the working world and start really putting what I've learned to the test and gaining knowledge/experience from other professionals, I definitely want much more time to keep learning with my awesome classmates and teachers, not to mention more time to work on the two senior projects that we are about to be solely focusing on for the next month. Fortunately, when I start feeling really panicked about my lack of time left, I have this thought to ground me: Being a progammer means I'll have a whole career during which I get to keep learning and challenging myself.

The learning doesn't end here at MakerSquare. In fact, I'm pretty sure once I get a job (and man, I hope I do!) that the learning will actually kick up a notch. And, instead of being intimidating, this is refreshing and exciting for me. This aspect of being a web developer and software engineer is one of the main reasons I decided to make a switch into this field. So, someone please remind me about these things I've just said when I have my regular freak outs about not having enough time in the coming month.

So, in speaking of the coming month, we have 2 days (today and tomorrow) that will resemble the normal flow of class and then it all changes. MakerSquare has changed it's approach to seniors graduating from having a demo day where groups present their 1 final project to more of a 'science fair approach'. This means we all will have worked on at least 2 projects, largely on our own. If we do work with a partner or group, you have to be able to show exactly what you did individually, which means it'll likely mean having a backend person pair up with a frontend person. I think this is really cool, but also slightly more stressful because I have to think of 2 projects! So, if anyone out there has a cool idea for a backend-driven project (i.e. manipulating data/objects) that would take about a week, don't hold out on me!

In preparation for these senior projects, we've been doing a lot of heavy javascript and rails learning. On the javascript side, we've focused on event listeners, closures, data-binding, MVC/MVP, and more. It's definitely been a step up from what we were doing previously. On the rails/backend side, we've been working with the Rails framework by doing small projects and moving older projects to Rails. I also used this time to move our 1st hackathon project - Give a Penny, Take a Penny - from using direct SQL queries/statements to activerecord so that I can take the next step of putting it on Rails and hosting it with Heroku.

Anyways, it's time for some more coffee. I need to wake up some more before hitting the Rails hard (haha, see what I did there? SEE)
