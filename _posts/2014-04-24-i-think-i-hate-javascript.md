<strong><span style="color:red;font-size:30px">Today</span></strong>. Ohhhhhh today. Let's just say this about today... if I hadn't serendipitiously planned a lunchtime run, my computer would be no more. It would be lying in pieces against a wall of this classroom. Thank you Javascript diagnostic from hell.

Like we did the Ruby diagnostic on Monday, this morning we started the frontend (so far mornings are frontend programming focused and afternoons backend) part of class with a lovely Javascript diagnostic. I thought I had rocked the Javascript portion of my prework. Conditionals, arrays, for loops, while/do while loops, functions, etc., were all a piece of cake. I thought what I had to worry about was the stuff they were going to teach me in the coming days. How wrong I was.

Opening the diagnostic, I started with the array tests and methods I had to complete. <em>"Psh, this will be easy"</em> Again, how wrong I was. But, sadly, as I later found, that was the easiest portion (and pretty much the only one I could finish). Once I got frustrated with the array tests that weren't passing, I moved onto strings. No, I cannot test whether a number is in the string. No, I cannot test whether a string has a repeating pattern. On to objects it was. But, no, I could not even begin to figure out how to write methods to pass those tests. And so on it went, with switch statements, functions, recursion (Whhhhaaa?)...

Luckily lunchtime marked the end of the frontend portion and a move back to Ruby (backend, which so far has been my friend). Class inheritance, super, and class methods seemed easy in comparison. Plus, we found out some of the desks are standing desks! YES. Oh, and I found out everyone else was pretty much as lost as me. Whew.

Here's hoping tomorrow is less frustrating and more successful!
