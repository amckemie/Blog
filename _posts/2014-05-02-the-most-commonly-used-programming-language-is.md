I laughed really hard when Shehzan, one of the founders of MakerSquare and current instructors for our cohort, told us that earlier this week as our joke of the day. Of course, it followed on the heels of some frustration with a Javascript diagnostic and a big Ruby project that I kept making tiny but hugely frustrating errors on, so I totally agreed. I think anyone who sat next to me at Cloud (Amy, Katie...looking at you), you are well aware of my random utterances of profanity when something goes wrong or someone did something crazy. I haven't changed since starting programming.

However, while I've definitely hashed out (haha, Ruby humor...) coding frustrations with both other students / instructors at MakerSquare and friends who are programmers, I've found that this joke can go the other way. Complementing many of my exclamations of "F@*!" have been more victorious "Hell yeahs!" Thus far, when looking back on the first two weeks of MakerSquare(MS), the two times I remember feeling most proud/victorious in having gotten something to work were using Javascript and jQuery to complete a Tic-Tac-Toe game and building our most complex Ruby program yet.

I'm not going to lie, I felt pretty badass when I finished the Tic-Tac-Toe game. It's interactive, let's players set their names and avatars(what their 'X' or 'O' looks like), and has an animation when someone wins the game. It also has a button that lets you play as many games as you like. Honestly, before coming to MS, I felt pretty strong on the basics of Javascript and Ruby. But when you asked me to connect files and make them interactive like this, I got a glazed over look like <a href="http://mrsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/bush-huh.jpg">this</a> or <a href="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7064/6818238266_598c60e672.jpg">this</a>. So being able to use HTML, CSS, and jQuery to make this program definitely left me looking around gleefully like <a href="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly7kzuvMQt1r4ibh3.jpg">this</a>. Hah.

The big Ruby project from this week, which I think we've spent about 2.5 days of class working on, on the other hand, did not feel quite as victorious. At least, not at first. Day 1 I wrote all my unit tests for my methods and instance variables for my two main classes. Easy peasy. So I went to bed feeling pretty confident that the next day, in which I would implement my class that would allow a user to interact with the terminal and classes, would be fun and productive. Oh, so wrong. To back up a bit, the main point of this project was to work on our de-coupling skills (breaking up big projects into smaller pieces and making sure that classes have specific responsibilities). A couple of guys and I had a really great (far too long (where did that hour go??)) discussion of the scope of the project and whether we needed another class to manage our Project class or simply utilize a class variable. I was still feeling pretty "Hell yeah" here rather than "F@*!" Little did I know what the rest of the day would bring. I basically spent the rest of the day in frustration, making little errors (not converting a string to an integer) that ate up probably a few hours and duplicating unnecessary code. By the end of about 10 hours coding on this project, I had it working, but it was not pretty.

Clay and I went to Due Forni that night, and it took me awhile to relax and get over the frustration of the day. But I also learned something else that was both really valuable and comforting. The "F@*!" and "Hell Yeah" could definitely coexist. Because, despite being mad at myself for unnecessary work and silly errors I had made, I really wanted to just keep working to make my code more efficient, concise, and better. This moment was just another confirmation for myself that I've made the right decision in making such a big career change.

After finishing this project, my partner Canaan and I spent most of our time refining another Ruby project - the game of War - by figuring out more efficient and faster ways to organize the game (Big O Notation). He and I ended week 2 on a (NERD ALERT) super cool note - learning how to make our own object structure: LinkedLists. I'm pretty sure I have never left a class feeling as accomplished and happy as I did yesterday.

So here's to 2 weeks under my belt and the start of week 3 on Monday! (Oh, and friends, sorry I'm basically nonexistent....)
