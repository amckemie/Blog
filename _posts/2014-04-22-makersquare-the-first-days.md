<strong><style="color:red">If</strong> you've talked to me in the last 4 months, you probably already know I'm making a huge change in my life: leaving my editing job at an awesome company to become a web programmer/software engineer. It was a big, fairly difficult decision to make, since I was leaving not only an area I was extremely comfortable with to do something I was decidely uncomfortable with, but also was leaving friends and a place that hasn't stopped having fun in the wake of my departure (ahem, Clouds, I know all about the boat party and I'm <em>jealous</em>). But it's something that I know is right for me and that, ultimately, I'm so incredibly excited about.

<h5><em> Aside</em></h5>
I'm a bad blogger...a not concise, wordy, too big for my pants blogger. Sorry, not sorry.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I spent the last couple of months stressing hard core about doing all my prework, which consisted of HTML, CSS, Ruby, Javascript, and jQuery, in addition to moving. As Clay, my lovely other half, can attest to, I was not the most pleasant person to be around this last week or so (sorry honey!).

But that's all changed. Am I less busy? No, far from it. The first three days have been extremely exciting, sometimes stressful (guys, figuring out the bus schedule is no joke), invigorating (I walked 3 miles yesterday alone!), frustrating (boooooo HMTL/CSS layouts), and fun. Yup, fun. Yes, I miss my friends from Cloud, having the luxury of doing whatever I wanted after work was over, seeing my dog everyday, etc etc. But I'm discovering that I made the right choice because I'm really loving every minute of this so far (even in the times of "I want to throw my computer across the room and kind of smack the instructor for giving me this work").

We've been practicing git like no other, using it for everything. Which is why TJ deserves a huge shout out, because he managed to make me kinda look like a git wiz for my first few days (Thank GOODNESS, because HTML and CSS are kicking my ass). We've forked and cloned what I imagine are only the very first of many Ruby projects and repos to come, then spent hours writing code to pass tests, writing our own ruby tests!, and pushing our brains.

Days 1 - 3 have been a blur and passed so extremely quickly that I'm wondering where all my time is going, whereas before, 5 p.m. usually couldn't come fast enough.

Sorry for that long winded intro without much programming thrown in, but hey, its the first post! Hopefully I'll have more later, but for now I've got to figure out how to put a div in the correct position and create some buttons!
