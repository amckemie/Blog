If you've talked to me in the last 4 months, you probably already know I'm making a huge change in my life: leaving my editing job at an awesome company to become a web programmer/software engineer. It was a big, fairly difficult decision to make, since I was leaving not only an area I was extremely comfortable with to do something I was decidely uncomfortable with, but also was leaving friends and a place that hasn't stopped having fun in the wake of my departure (ahem, Clouds, I know all about the boat party and I'm <em>jealous</em>). But it's something that I know is right for me and that, ultimately, I'm so incredibly excited about.

#### Aside
I'm a bad blogger...a not concise, wordy, too big for my pants blogger. Sorry, not sorry.

I spent the last couple of months stressing hard core about doing all my prework, which consisted of HTML, CSS, Ruby, Javascript, and jQuery, in addition to moving. As Clay, my lovely other half, can attest to, I was not the most pleasant person to be around this last week or so (sorry honey!).
